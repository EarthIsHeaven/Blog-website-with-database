# Blog-website-with-database

"In this project, I have enhanced a blogging website using MongoDB and Mongoose, enabling users to store their blogs in a database. If a user clicks on 'Read More,' they will be redirected to another page called 'post.ejs,' utilizing the unique ID of the respective blog post."
